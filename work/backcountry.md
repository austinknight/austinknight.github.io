    <p>I worked at <a href="https://www.backcountry.com/" nofolow>Backcountry.com</a> as a front end software engineer. During my time there, I helped launch a new product called Detour, a local adventure-guide marketplace. Detour didn't end up being a good market fit for the product so it was eventually shut down. After that, I moved to the Steep & Cheap team where I spent most of my time while working for Backcountry. You can visit <a href="https://www.steepandcheap.com/">steepandcheap.com</a> to see the product I did front end for. I also architected the Steep & Cheap <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id387037488?mt=8">mobile application</a> built on the Ionic mobile platform.</p>
