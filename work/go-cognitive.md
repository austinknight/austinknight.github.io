    <p>GoCognitive is an educational resource hub for learning about cognitive psychology. It is used by students, instructors, researchers, and people generally interested in the subject of neuroscience. The website was originally developed in 2008, and is maintained by professors and graduate students at the University of Idaho.</p>
    <p>I was approached by GoCognitive to re-design and develop the site. The newest version I created was launched in January of 2012. GoCognitive is able to manage categorized libraries of information that users can filter. Lastly, the re-design also included a responsive layout that can adapt to mobile devices. I stopped maintaining this project in 2012 after graduating from college.</p>
