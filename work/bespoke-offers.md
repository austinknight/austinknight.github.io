    <p>London, U.K. based bank Barclaycard had the idea of creating a targeted digital offers marketplace called Bespoke Offers. I worked on the team to create the Bespoke Offers platform which included a consumer e-commerce application, a management portal for merchants, and other administrative tools to manage various parts of the system.</p>

    <p>I worked with a team of front end developers and engineers, where I did UI and UX design as well as front end implementation. The application was built with Ruby on Rails utilizing HTML, SASS, Javascript/jQuery, ERB, and Compass on the front end.</p>
