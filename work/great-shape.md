    <p>Great Shape! (GS!) is nonprofit organization that provides various types of humanitarian aid to children and families in Jamaica. I began working with GS! through an internship with Let it Shine Media. During my senior year of college, I chose to re-brand the organization and re-design their website as part of my final BFA thesis project.</p>
    <p>The goal of the re-branding was to focus the organization’s message of ‘service in action’ into a visual representation without losing some of their already established visual marks. The brand and website design, overall, have been directed to evoke a fun, passionate, and personal feeling to their audience. I used combination of light-hearted graphics and cheerful imagery to achieve this idea.</p>
