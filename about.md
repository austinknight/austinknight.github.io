    <p>I'm Austin. I am a designer and software engineer, husband, skateboarder, snowboarder and a kick-ass friend. I went to school at the University of Idaho where I earned a BFA in graphic design. I was first introduced to web development when I started creating a website for my now inactive company, Amity Outerwear. Most of my time these days is spent doing more front-end development than design, and I love every minute of it! Right now, I work as a Software Engineer at InsideSales.com.</p>
    <p>This site is where I talk about what I work on, and my thoughts about web-related stuff. You can follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/austinknight">Twitter</a> for updates!</p>
